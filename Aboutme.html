      <hr>
      <p>
        I was born in 1998 and I grew up in ***********. My mom was from ******* and my dad was from *****.
        
        <br>
        I have two siblings, one older and one younger.
        <br>
        I like to stay active. As a kid I played football, soccer, and lacrosse. Unfortunately I can't continue due to 3 acl tears.
        <br>
        I want to do research in some sort of biotech field, but in the meantime, I'm learning skills to help me create things I want to create.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you enjoy!
